Is there any opportunity for her to do that?##对。莉迪亚也喜欢建造东西。有什么机会让她做这个吗？\n[02:16.59]Well, they have a competition to see who can make the highest tower.You'd be amazed how high they can go.##嗯，他们有一个比赛，看谁能造出最高的塔。你会惊讶于他们能做多高。\n[02:24.46]Right.##很好。\n[02:25.31]But they're learning all the time as well as having fun.##他们一直在学习，同时也在享受乐趣。\n[02:29.36]For example, one thing they do is to design and build a car that's attached to a balloon,and the force of the air in that actually powers the car and makes it move along.##例如，其中一个活动是设计和建造一辆连接在气球上的汽车，空气的力量实际上为汽车提供了动力，使它向前移动。\n[02:41.55]They go really fast too.##他们的速度也非常快。\n[02:43.68]OK, well, all this sounds perfect.##好吧，这一切听起来很完美。\n[02:47.68]\n[03:34.36]Now Carly, that's my older daughter, has just had her seventh birthday,so presumably she'd be in a different group?##现在来说说卡莉，也就是我的大女儿，刚刚过完她的七岁生日，所以她应该是在一个不同的小组里吧？\n[03:43.00]Yes, she'd be in the Junior Engineers. That's for children from six to eight.##是的，她会在初级工程师组。那是为六到八岁的孩子准备的。\n[03:49.90]And do they do the same sorts of activities?##他们做同样的活动吗？\n[03:52.71]Some are the same, but a bit more advanced.  So they work out how to build model vehicles, things like cars and trucks, but also how to construct animals using the same sorts of material and technique,and then they learn how they can program them and make them move.##有些是一样的，但要更高级一些。他们研究如何建造车辆模型，比如汽车和卡车，也研究如何用同样的材料和技术建造动物，然后他们学习如何给它们编程，让它们移动。\n[04:13.22]So they learn a bit of coding?##所以他们学会了一些编程？\n[04:15.32]They do. They pick it up really quickly. ##是的。他们很快就能学会。\n[04:18.40]We're there to help if they need it, but they learn from one another too.##如果他们需要，我们会在那里提供帮助，但他们也会互相学习。\n[04:23.464]Right. And do they have competitions too?##真好。那他们也有比赛吗？\n[04:27.21]Yes, with the Junior Engineers, it's to use recycled materials like card and wood to build a bridge, and the longest one gets a prize.##是的，初级工程师的比赛是用回收的材料，如卡片和木头，来建造一座桥，最长的桥可以得到奖励。\n[04:38.32]That sounds fun. I wouldn't mind doing that myself!##这听起来很有趣。我不介意自己做这个 !\n[04:41.79]Then they have something a bit different, which is to think up an idea for a five-minute movie and then film it,using special animation software.##然后他们有一些不同的东西，那就是想出一个五分钟的电影的想法，然后用特殊的动画软件把它拍下来。\n[04:53.08]You'd be amazed what they come up with.##你会惊讶于他们想出来的东西。\n[04:55.44]And of course, that's something they can put on their phone and take home to show all their friends.##当然，这也是他们可以放在手机里，带回家给所有的朋友看的东西。\n[05:00.93]Exactly, And then they also build a robot in the shape of a human,and they decorate it and program it so that it can move its arms and legs.##没错。然后，他们还会建造了一个人类形状的机器人，他们对其进行装饰，并对其进行编程，使其能够移动手臂和腿。\n[05:11.92]Perfect. So, is it the same price as the Tiny Engineers?##完美。那么，它的价格和 \"小工程师 \"一样吗？\n[05:16.77]It's just a bit more: £50 for the five weeks.##只是多一点。五个星期是50英镑。\n[05:20.87]And are the classes on a Monday, too?##那么课程也是在星期一吗？\n[05:23.33]They used to be, but we found it didn't give our staff enough time to clear up after the first workshop,so we moved them to Wednesdays.##以前是的，但我们发现这样做没有给我们的员工足够的时间在第一次研讨会后进行清理，所以我们把它移到了星期三。\n[05:33.01]The classes are held in the morning from ten to eleven.##这些课程是在上午十点到十一点举行的。\n[05:37.04]OK. That's better for me actually. ##好的，这对我来说其实更好。\n[05:40.92]And what about the location? Where exactly are the workshops held?##那地点呢？研讨会到底是在哪里举行的？\n[05:45.04]They're in building 10A - there's a big sign on the door,you can't miss it, and that's in Fradstone Industrial Estate.##他们在10A楼--门上有一个大牌子，你不可能错过它，那是在弗拉德斯通工业区。\n[05:53.56]Sorry?##什么？\n[05:54.62]Fradstone - that's F-R-A-D-S-T-O-N-E.##弗拉德斯通--就是F-R-A-D-S-T-O-N-E。\n[06:05.12]And that's in Grasford, isn't it?##那是在Grasford，对吗？\n[06:07.68]Yes, up past the station.##是的，在车站的前面。\n[06:10.06]And will I have any parking problems there?##在那里会有任何停车问题吗？\n[06:12.68]No, there's always plenty available. So would you like to enrol Lydia and Carly now?##不会，那里总是有很多停车位。那么，你现在想为莉迪亚和卡莉报名吗？\n[06:19.09]OK.##好的。\n[06:20.24]So can I have your full name ...##那么我可以知道你的全名吗...？\n[06:23.24]",

      "listenDetail": "[01:11.88]Ancient philosophy is not just about talking or lecturing, or even reading long, dense books.##古代哲学不仅仅是说话、讲课，甚至是读又长又厚的书。\n[01:20.15]In fact, it is something people have used throughout history - to solve their problems and to achieve their greatest triumphs.##事实上，这是贯穿人类历史上的工具——用来解决问题和取得最大胜利。\n[01:30.25]Specifically, I am referring to Stoicism, which, in my opinion, is the most practical of all philosophies and therefore the most appealing. ##具体来说，我指的是斯多葛主义，在我看来，它是所有哲学中最实用的，因此也是最吸引人的。\n[01:41.96]Stoicism was founded in Ancient Greece by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BC, but was practised by the likes of Epictetus, Cato, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius. ##斯多葛学派是公元前3世纪早期由提提翁的芝诺(Zeno of Citium)在古希腊创立的，但爱比克泰德(Epictetus)、加图(Cato)、塞内加(Seneca)和马可·奥里利乌斯(Marcus Aurelius)等人都践行过。\n[01:56.41]Amazingly, we still have access to these ideas, despite the fact that the most famous Stoics never wrote anything down for publication. ##令人惊讶的是，我们仍然可以触到这些思想，尽管最著名的斯多葛学派从来没有写过任何东西以供出版。\n[02:05.91]Cato definitely didn't. Marcus Aurelius never intended his Meditations to be anything but personal. ##卡托绝对是没有的。马可·奥勒留从来没有想过让他的《沉思录》不是个人的。\n[02:13.86]Seneca's letters were, well, letters and Epictetus' thoughts come to us by way of a note-taking student.##塞内加的书信和爱比克泰德的思想都是通过一个学生的笔记传来的。\n[02:24.04]Stoic principles were based on the idea that its followers could have an unshakable happiness in this life and the key to achieving this was virtue. ##斯多葛学派的原则是建立在这样一种观念上的，即其追随者可以在这一生中获得不可动摇的幸福，而实现这一幸福的关键是美德。\n[02:35.68]The road to virtue, in turn, lay in understanding that destructive emotions, like anger and jealousy, are under our conscious control - they don't have to control us, because we can learn to control them. ##反过来说，通往美德之路，在于理解像愤怒和嫉妒这样的破坏性情绪是在我们的意识控制之下的--它们不必控制我们，因为我们可以学会控制它们。\n[02:53.37]In the words of Epictetus:\"external events I cannot control, but the choices I make with regard to them, I do control'.##用爱比克泰德的话来说\"我无法控制外部事件。而我对他们所做的选择我能控制”。\n[03:03.92]The modern day philosopher and writer Nassim Nicholas Taleb defines a Stoic as someone who has a different perspective on experiences which most of us would see as wholly negative##现代哲学家和作家纳西姆·尼古拉斯·塔勒布将禁欲主义者定义为对我们大多数人认为完全消极的经历持不同观点的人：\n[03:18.53]a Stoic 'transforms fear into caution, pain into transformation, mistakes into initiation and desire into undertaking'. ##禁欲主义者“将恐惧转化为谨慎，将痛苦转化为转变，将错误转化为启蒙，将欲望转化为事业”。\n[03:31.79]Using this definition as a model, we can see that throughout the centuries Stoicism has been practised in more recent history by kings, presidents, artists, writers and entrepreneurs.##用这个定义作为模型，我们可以看到，在最近的历史中，国王、总统、艺术家、作家和企业家在几个世纪里一直奉行斯多葛主义。\n[03:52.06]The founding fathers of the United States were inspired by the philosophy. ##美国的开国元勋都受到了这种哲学的启发。\n[03:56.73]George Washington was introduced to Stoicism by his neighbours at age seventeen,and later, put on a play based on the life of Cato to inspire his men. ##乔治·华盛顿17岁时被他的邻居介绍了斯多葛学派，后来又上演了一部以卡托的生活为原型的戏剧来激励他的部下。\n[04:08.22]Thomas Jefferson kept a copy of Seneca beside his bed.##托马斯·杰斐逊在床边放了一本塞内加的书。\n[04:13.38]Writers and artists have also been inspired by the stoics. Eugene Delacroix, the renowned French Romantic artist (known best for his painting Liberty Leading the People) was an ardent Stoic,referring to it as his “consoling religion”.##作家和艺术家也受到了禁欲主义者的启发。德拉克罗瓦，著名的法国浪漫主义艺术家(以《自由领导人民》闻名)是一个热情的斯多葛主义者，并将其称为自己的“慰藉宗教”。\n[04:32.93]The economist Adam Smith's theories on capitalism were significantly influenced by the Stoicism that he studied as a schoolboy, under a teacher who had translated Marcus Aurelius' works. ##经济学家亚当•斯密的资本主义理论深受斯多葛学派的影响，在他还是个小学生时，师从翻译过马可•奥勒留著作的老师。\n[04:47.69]Today's political leaders are no different, with many finding their inspiration from the ancient texts. ##今天的政治领导人也不例外，许多人从古代文献中找到了灵感。\n[04:55.00]Former US president Bill Clinton rereads Marcus Aurelius every single year,and many have compared former President Obama's calm leadership style to that of Cato. ##美国前总统比尔·克林顿每年都会重读马可·奥勒留的书，很多人将前总统奥巴马冷静的领导风格比作卡托的领导风格。\n[05:08.42]Wen Jiabao,the former prime minister of China, claims that Meditations is one of two books he travels with and that he has read it more than one hundred times over the course of his life.##中国前总理温家宝称，《禅修》是他随身携带的两本书之一，他一生中读了一百多次。\n[05:22.16]Stoicism had a profound influence on Albert Ellis, who invented Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, which is used to help people manage their problems by changing the way that they think and behave. It's most commonly used to treat depression.##禁欲主义对阿尔伯特·埃利斯产生了深远的影响。埃利斯发明了认知行为疗法，用来帮助人们通过改变思维和行为方式来管理他们的问题。\n[05:39.66]The idea is that we can take control of our lives by challenging the irrational beliefs that create our faulty thinking, symptoms and behaviours by using logic instead.##它最常被用来治疗抑郁症。主要思想是，我们可以通过使用逻辑来挑战那些导致我们错误思维症状和行为的非理性信念以控制我们的生活。\n[05:52.43]Stoicism has also become popular in the world of business. Stoic principles can build the resilience and state of mind required to overcome setbacks because Stoics teach turning obstacles into opportunity. ##斯多葛主义在商界也很流行。斯多葛主义原则可以建立克服挫折所需的恢复力和心理状态，因为斯多葛主义教授了如何将阻碍转变为机会。\n[06:07.96]A lesson every business entrepreneur needs to learn.##这是每个企业家都需要学习的一课。\n[06:12.95]I would argue that studying Stoicism is as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago,thanks to its brilliant insights into how to lead a good life. ##我想声明的是，由于斯多葛主义在如何过好生活方面的杰出见解，它在今天和在2000年前一样重要。\n[06:25.58]At the very root of the thinking, there is a very simple way of living - control what you can and accept what you can't. ##从这种想法的根源去看，有一种非常简单的生活方式是——控制你能做的，接受你不能做的。\n[06:35.21]This is not as easy as it sounds and will require considerable practice - it can take a lifetime to master. ##这并不像听起来那么容易，需要大量的练习——可能需要一辈子的时间才能掌握。\n[06:44.34]The Stoics also believed the most important foundation for a good and happy life is not money, fame, power or pleasure, ##斯多葛学派还认为，美好幸福生活最重要的基础不是金钱、名誉、权力或快乐，\n[06:54.78]but having a disciplined and principled character - something which seems to resonate with many people today.##而是拥有自律和有原则的性格——这一点今天似乎能与许多人产生共鸣。\n[07:04.26]",
