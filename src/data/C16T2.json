So can you give me an idea of how much this will cost? I've got about 360 photos I think.##好的没问题。所以您方便告诉我一下大概的价格吗？我大约有360张照片。\n[02:32.95]We charge £195 for 300 to 400 photos for the basic service.##我们的基础收费是300-400张照片195磅。\n[02:40.15]OK. And does that include the disk?##那这包括磁盘的费用吗？\n[02:43.28]Yes, one disk - but you can get extra ones for £5 each.##是的，包含一个磁盘。但是如果你还想要额外的磁盘，5磅一个。\n[02:48.44]That's good. So do I need to pay when I send you the photos?##好的。我要在发照片的时候支付费用吗？\n[02:53.40]No, we won't need anything until we've actually copied the pictures. ##不用。在我们把照片影印好之前您不需要支付任何费用。\n[02:58.09]Then we'll let you know how much it is, and once we've received the payment, we'll send the parcel off to you.##工作完成之后我们会告知您相关费用，一旦我们确认您已支付成功，我们就会把物品给您寄过去。\n[03:04.72]Right.##好的。\n[03:07.88]\n[03:52.24]Is there anything else you'd like to ask about our services?##您还有一些其他想要咨询的么？\n[03:56.18]Yes. I' ve roughly sorted out the photos into groups, according to what they' re about-so can you keep them in those groups when you copy them?##我大致根据照片内容把他们分类了一下。所以你们能在影印的时候还保留他们的分类吗？\n[04:06.77]Sure. We'll save each group in a different folder on the disk and if you like, you can suggest a name for each folder.##当然。如果您愿意的话我们可以把它们按分组放在磁盘不同的文件夹里，我们还可以按照您的要求给每一个文件夹命名。\n[04:14.65]So I could have one called 'Grandparents' for instance?##那比方说我可以让其中一个文件夹叫“祖父母”？\n[04:19.00]Exactly.##是的。\n[04:20.85]And do you do anything besides scan the photos? Like, can you make any improvements?##你们除了扫描照片还会有其他操作吗？比如可以做一些修复么？\n[04:27.68]Yes, in the standard service each photo is checked, and we can sometimes touch up the colour a bit, or improve the contrast - that can make a big difference.##是的，如果您选标准服务的话，那么每张照片都会被检查，有时会稍微润色一下，或者改善一下对比度，这效果就很不一样了。\n[04:38.99]OK. And some of the photos are actually quite fragile - they won't get damaged in the process, will they?##好的。有一些照片特别易损，他们在影印过程中不会坏了吧？\n[04:46.50]No, if any look particularly fragile, we'd do them by hand. We do realise how precious these old photos can be.##不会的。如果照片看起来很容易坏的话，我们就会手工操作了。我们非常明白这些老照片是十分珍贵的。\n[04:54.77]Sure.##嗯嗯。\n[04:55.68]And another thing is we can make changes to a photo if you want - so if you want to remove an object from a photo,or maybe alter the background, we can do that.##如果您愿意尝试的话我们还可以对照片做一些其他的调整，比如您想要移除照片中的某个物件，或者是进行背景的更换，这些都是可以的。\n[05:07.38]Really? I might be interested in that. I'll have a look through the photos and see.##真的吗？这个我很是感兴趣呢。我等下去看一下那些照片。\n[05:14.56]Oh, and talking of fixing photos - I've got a few that aren't properly in focus. Can you do anything to make that better?##哦，说到照片修复，我这有一些照片是没有对上焦的，这个能修复吗？\n[05:23.35]No, I'm afraid that's one thing we can't do.##不行哦，我们对这件事也无能为力。\n[05:26.99]OK.##好吧。\n[05:27.96]Any other information I can give you?##您还有其他的要咨询吗？\n[05:30.54]Er... oh, how long will it all take?##呃...对了，照片都弄好要多久呢？\n[05:34.52]We aim to get the copying done in ten days.##我们会在10天之内完成。\n[05:37.80]Fine. Right, well I'll get the photos packed up in a box and post them off to you.##嗯，好的。我把照片装箱打包一下就寄给你们。\n[05:44.28]Right. If you've got a strong cardboard box, that's best. We've found that plastic ones sometimes break in the post.##嗯，您最好用硬纸板盒子去包装邮寄，因为塑料的包装盒有时会在运输的过程中坏掉。\n[05:52.65]OK. Right, thanks for your help. Bye.##好的，那麻烦您啦。拜拜！\n[05:57.49]Bye.##再见！\n[05:59.49]",

##食堂总是在午饭的时候特别忙，\n[02:33.98]in fact it's often full to capacity, because a lot of our pupils like the food that's on offer there. ##事实上它也是在满负荷运转的，因为我们大部分的学生都喜欢吃食堂的饭。\n[02:41.36]But there's only one serving point, so most pupils have to wait a considerable time to be served. ##这主要是因为只有一个打饭窗口，所以大部分学生就要等很长时间。\n[02:49.27] This is obviously unsatisfactory, as they may have hardly finished their lunch before afternoon lessons start.##这是非常不好的，因为他们可能在下午开始上课前还没吃完午饭。\n[02:57.36]So we've had a new Food Hall built, and this will come into use next week. ##所以我们建了一个新的餐饮中心，下周就可以上线运营了。\n[03:04.48] It'll have several serving areas, and I'll give you more details about those in a minute,##那有非常多的打饭窗口，我等下会给大家详细介绍，\n[03:10.40]but one thing we ask you to do, to help in the smooth running of the Food Hall, ##但是在此之前，为了让我们的餐饮中心运转的更顺畅，\n[03:15.60]is to discuss with your children each morning which type of food they want to eat that day, so they can go straight to the relevant serving point.##我需要各位家长在每天早晨都问一下孩子他们当天想吃什么，这样他们就能直接去选好的打饭窗口了。\n[03:25.90] There won't be any junk food -
