No problem.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Right, so can you tell me which station you're travelling back to?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Staunfirth, where I live.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Can I just check the spelling? S-T-A-U-N-F-1-R-T-H?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:That's right.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:And you travelled from there this morning?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Yes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK, good. Next, can I ask what kind of ticket you bought? I assume it wasn't a season ticket, as you don't travel every day.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:That's right. No, I just got a normal return ticket. I don't have a rail card so I didn't&nbsp;</div>\n<div>get any discount. I keep meaning to get one because it's a lot cheaper.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Yes - you'd have saved 20% on your ticket today. So you paid the full price for your ticket?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:I paid &pound;23.70.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK. Do you think that's good value for money?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Not really. I think it's too much for a journey that only takes 45 minutes.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Yes, that's one of the main complaints we get. So, you didn't buy your ticket in advance?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:No. I know it's cheaper if you buy a week in advance but I didn't know I was coming then.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:I know. You can't always plan ahead. So, did you buy it this morning?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:No, it was yesterday.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Right. And do you usually buy your tickets at the station?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Well, I do usually but the ticket office closes early and I hate using ticket machines. I think ticket offices shou ld be open for longer hours. There's always a queue for the machines and they're often out of order.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:A lot of customers are saying the same thing.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:So to answer your question ... I got an e-ticket online.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK. Thank you. Now I'd like to ask you about your satisfaction with your journey. So what would you say you were most satisfied with today?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Well, I like the wifi on the train. It's improved a lot. It makes it easier for me to&nbsp;</div>\n<div>work if I want to.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:That's the first time today anyone's mentioned that. It's good to get some positive feedback on that.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Mmm.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:And, is there anyth ing you weren't satisfied with?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Well, normally, the trains run on time and are pretty reliable but today there was a&nbsp;</div>\n<div>delay: the train was about 15 minutes behind schedule.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK. I'll put that down. Now I'd also like to ask about the facil ities at this station .&nbsp;</div>\n<div>You've probably noticed that the whole station's been upgraded. What are you most satisfied with?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:I think the best thing is that they've improved the amount of informat ion about train times etc. that's given to passengers - it's much clearer - before there was only one board and I couldn't always see it properly- which was frustrating.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:That's good. And is there anything you're not satisfied with?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Let's see ... I think things have genera lly improved a lot. The trains are much&nbsp;</div>\n<div>more modern and I like the new cafe. But one thing is that there aren't enough places to sit down, especially on the platforms.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK - so I'll put 'seating' down, shall 1, as the thing you're least satisfied with?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Yes. OK.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:Can I ask your opinion about some of the other facilities? We'd like feedback on&nbsp;</div>\n<div>whether people are satisfied, dissatisfied or neither satisfied nor dissatisfied.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:OK.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:What about the parking at the station?&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Well to be honest, I don't really have an opinion as I never use it.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:So, neither satisfied nor dissatisfied for that then.&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>SOPHIE:Yes, I suppose so ...&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>MAN:OK, and what about ... ?</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>",

What are you most satisfied with? ##好的。我会记下来。现在我想知道有关火车站设施的情况。您也许已经注意到了整个火车站已经翻新升级了。您最满意的是什么?\n[05:32.81]I think the best thing is that they've improved the amount of information about train times etc. that's given to passengers - it's much clearer - before there was only one board and I couldn't always see it properly- which was frustrating. ##我觉得最好的就是他们增加了有关火车班次时间等等的信息。旅客们看时间看得更清楚了。之前只有一个板子,我经常看不清上面的字,这很令人沮丧。\n[05:48.66]That's good. And is there anything you're not satisfied with? ##那就好。有什么不满意的吗?\n[05:52.71]Let's see ... I think things have generally improved a lot. The trains are much more modern and I like the new cafe.

Though I have to admit I haven't done much research yet.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>ANNIE:Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I'd seen some 18th\u0002and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse. But I didn't realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn't melt for months.

In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average , and a lot last for 20 or more. So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge. they're not expensive. compared with some household appliances.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>ANNIE:True. I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs. l\"m sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JACK:Yes, there\"s been quite a change.</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n<div>JACK:Right. let's make a list of topics to cover in our presentation. and decide who\"s going to do more research on them.

      "listenDetail": "[00:54.15]OK, Jack. Before we plan our presentation about refrigeration, let's discuss what we've discovered so far.##好了杰克。在我们准备关于冰箱的展示之前让我们讨论一下我们目前找到的信息吧。\n[01:01.83]Fine, Annie. Though I have to admit I haven't done much research yet.##好的,安妮。但是我得承认我还没有做很多的研究。\n[01:05.51]Nor me. But I found an interesting article about icehouses. I'd seen some 18th and 19th-century ones here in the UK, so I knew they were often built in a shady area or underground, close to lakes that might freeze in the winter. Then blocks of ice could be cut and stored in the icehouse. But I didn't realise that insulating the blocks with straw or sawdust meant they didn't melt for months. The ancient Romans had refrigeration, too. ##我也没有。但是我发现了一篇关于冰室的文章,很有趣。我已经看了一些英国的18世纪和19世纪的冰室。所以我知道冰室经常建于阴凉的地方或者地下,靠近冬季可能结冰的湖泊。然后冰块可以被切割并且储存在冰室中。但是我没想到用稻草或者锯末来隔热可以使冰数月不化。古罗马也有制冷术。\n[01:36.86]I didn't know that.##我还不知道。\n[01:37.90]Yes, pits were dug in the ground, and snow was imported from the mountains—even though they were at quite a distance. The snow was stored in the pits. Ice formed at the bottom of it. Both the ice and the snow were then sold. The ice cost more than the snow and my guess is that only the wealthy members of society could afford it.##是的,先在地面挖坑,将远处山上的雪移过来。雪被储存在土坑中，在底部会形成冰。冰和雪之后会被卖掉。冰比雪的价格更贵。我猜测只有社会上的富裕阶层可以用得起。\n[02:01.03]I wouldn't be surprised. I also came across an article about modern domestic fridges. Several different technologies are used, but they were too complex for me to understand.##我觉得也不惊奇。我还看到一篇关于现代家用冰箱的文章。用到了许多不同的科技,但是对我来说很难理解。\n[02:11.56]You have to wonder what happens when people get rid of old ones.## 你必须考虑一下旧冰箱被废弃的时候会发生什么。\n[02:15.12]You mean because the gases in them are harmful for the environment?##你的意思是因为冰箱中的气体会污染环境?\n[02:18.25]Exactly. At least there are now plenty of organisations that will recycle most of the components safely, but of course some people just dump old fridges in the countryside.##是的。至少现在有不少的组织都会安全回收其中的大部分零件,当然也有人直接把旧冰箱丢在乡下。\n[02:29.35]It's hard to see how they can be stopped unfortunately. In the UK we get rid of three million a year altogether!##糟糕的是很难明确应该如何阻止他们。在英国一年间一共要丢弃300万台冰箱。\n[02:36.31]That sounds a lot, especially because fridges hardly ever break down.##听起来真不少,尤其是因为冰箱几乎不会坏掉。\n[02:40.97]That's right. In this country we keep domestic fridges for 11 years on average , and a lot last for 20 or more. So if you divide the cost by the number of years you can use a fridge. they're not expensive. compared with some household appliances.##你说得对。在英国本地,平均每台冰箱的使用时间是11年,很多能用20年或者更久。所以如果把成本平均到冰箱的使用时间上,和其他家用电器比起来,冰箱的价格并不贵。\n[02:54.79]True. I suppose manufacturers encourage people to spend more by making them different colours and designs. l\"m sure when my parents bought their first fridge they had hardly any choice!##是的。我觉得制造厂商通过制造不同颜色和设计的冰箱来鼓励大家购买。我确定我父母买第一个冰箱的时候几乎没有选择。\n[03:06.69]Yes, there's been quite a change.##是的,这确实是一个相当大的变化。\n[03:11.39]\n[03:55.78]Right. let's make a list of topics to cover in our presentation. and decide who\"s going to do more research on them. Then later. we can get together and plan the next step.##好了,让我们来列一个关于我们展示要谈到的话题的单子,然后决定谁将要再多做些研究。之后,我们再一起做下一步计划。\n[04:04.82]OK. How about starting with how useful refrigeration is. and the range of goods that are refrigerated nowadays? Because of course it's not just food and drinks.##好的。展示以冰箱的用途开始怎么样?再说下现在需要冷藏的各个种类的商品。因为冰箱里放的当然不止是食物和饮料。\n[04:16.70]No, I suppose flowers and medicines are refrigerated, too. ##是的,我想鲜花和药品也要冷藏。\n[04:20.46]And computers. I could do that, unless you particularly want to.##还有电脑。我可以讲这个,除非你特别想做。\n[04:25.45]No, that's fine by me. What about the effects of refrigeration on people's health? After all, some of the chemicals used in the 19th century were pretty harmful, but there have been lots of benefits too, like always having access to fresh food. Do you fancy dealing with that?##我就不用了。聊聊冰箱对人的健康的影响怎么样?毕竟19世纪的冰箱用到的化学物质对人身体伤害特别大,但是冰箱也有很多好处,比如总能让人们吃到新鲜的食物。你想要做这个吗?\n[04:41.31]I'm not terribly keen, to be honest.##说实话,我不是很想做。\n[04:44.55]Nor me. My mind just goes blank when I read anything about chemicals.##我也不想。我一读到和化学的东西脑子就一片空白。\n[04:48.90]Oh, all right then. I'll do you a favour. But you owe me. Jack. OK. What about the effects on food producers, like farmers in poorer countries being able to export their produce to developed countries? Something for you , maybe?##噢,那就算了,我帮你这个忙吧。但是杰克,记得你欠我一次啊。我来做吧。关于冰箱对食品制作者的影响呢?比如较为贫穷国家的农民能够把他们的产品出口到发达国家去?也许你来做这个？\n[05:06.29]I don't mind. It should be quite interesting . ##我没问题。应该还挺有趣的。\n[05:08.95]I think we should also look at how refrigeration has helped whole cities - like Las Vegas, which couldn't exist without refrigeration because it's in the middle of a desert.##我认为我们应该聊一下冰箱是如何帮助整个城市的,比如拉斯维加斯。如果无法制冷,拉斯维加斯就不会存在了,因为它是位于沙漠中的城市。\n[05:19.45]Right. I had a quick look at an economics book in the library that's got a chapter about this sort of thing. I could give you the title. if you want to do this section.##好的。我之前在图书馆翻阅过一本经济学的书,里面有一章就是讲这个的。如果你想负责这个部分的话,我可以把书名给你。\n[05:27.94]Not particularly, to be honest. I find economics books pretty heavy going, as a rule. ##说实话,我并不是很想做。我发现通常来说经济学的书籍很难读。\n[05:33.57]OK. leave it to me. then.##那就交给我吧。\n[05:35.08]Thanks. Then there's transport, and the difference that refrigerated trucks have made. I wouldn't mind having a go at that.##谢谢啦。还有交通方面。冷藏车带来的变化。我愿意做这一部分。\n[05:44.37]Don't forget trains. too. I read something about milk and butter being transported in refrigerated railroad cars in the USA, right back in the 1840s.##别忘了还有火车。我之前读到早在19世纪40年代的美国,牛奶和黄油是用带有冷藏功能的火车运输的。\n[05:53.72]I hadn't thought of trains . Thanks.## 我之前没想到火车。谢谢。\n[05:56.47]Shall we have a separate section on domestic fridges? After all, they're something everyone's familiar with.##我们要不要单用一个部分讲家用冰箱?毕竟,这是大家都熟悉的内容。\n[06:01.39]What about spliting it into two? You could investigate 19th- and 20th century fridges, and I'll concentrate on what's available these days, and how manufacturers differentiate their products from those of their competitors . ##咱们把它分成两部分怎么样?你可以调查一下19和20世纪的冰箱。我来负责现代冰箱,还有冰箱制造厂商如何制造与竞争者不同的产品。\n[06:16.07]OK, that'd suit me.##可以，这个很适合我。\n[06:20.57]",

Before this, the vast majority of people had very few possessions, but all that was changed by the Industrial Revolution. ##事实上,在19世纪,居民所有物的数量和品质成为国家财富的指标。在此之前,大部分人只有很少的财产,但是这一都在工业革命时期发生了改变。\n[02:00.15]This was the era from the mid-18th to the late 19th century, when improvements in how goods were made as well as in technology triggered massive social changes that transformed life for just about everybody in several key areas.##从18世纪中到19世纪末这段时期,产品制作工艺的提升、技术的进步促使很多领域发生了巨大社会变革在几个关键领域改变了几乎每个人的生活。\n[02:16.47]First let's look at manufacturing. When it comes to manufacturing, we tend to think of the Industrial Revolution in images of steam engines and coal. ##首先,我们来聊聊制造业。提到制造业,人们倾向于将工业革命与蒸汽机和煤炭联想起来。\n[02:28.57]And it's true that the Industrial Revolution couldn't have taken place at all if it weren't for these new sources of power.They marked an important shift away from the traditional watermills and windmills that had dominated before this. ##的确，如果没有这些新的能源，工业革命根本就不可能发生。它们标志着传统水磨坊和风车在此之前的主导地位发生了重大转变。\n[02:44.45]The most advanced industry for much of the 19th century was textiles. This meant that fashionable fabrics, and lace and ribbons were made available to everyone.##在19世纪大部分时间里最先进的工业是纺织业。这意昧着任何人能都用时尚的材料、蕾丝和丝带。\n[02:56.83]Before the Industrial Revolution, most people made goods to sell in small workshops, often in their own homes. But enormous new machines were now being created that could produce the goods faster and on a larger scale, and these required a lot more space. ##工业革命之前,大多数人都是在小作坊里,通常是在自己家里制造商品出售的。但是当时,巨大的新机器正在被创造出来,它们能够更快、更大规模地生产商品,而这需要更多的空间。\n[03:16.05]So large factories were built, replacing the workshops, and forcing workers to travel to work. In fact, large numbers of people migrated from villages into towns as a result.##于是人们建造了大工厂,取代了小作坊,迫使工人们去上班。事实上,大量的人因此从村庄迁移到城镇。\n[03:33.88]As well as manufacturing, there were new technologies in transport, contributing to the growth of consumerism. The horse-drawn stagecoaches and carts of the 18th century, which carried very few people and goods, and travelled slowly along poorly surfaced roads, were gradually replaced by the numerous canals that were constructed. ## 除了制造业,运输业也出现了新技术,促进了消费主义的发展。在18世纪时,驿站马车和马拉货车的运输能力很差,在粗糙的路面上行进速度很慢。这种交通方式逐渐被修建的众多运河取代。\n[03:56.83]These were particularly important for the transportation of goods. The canals gradually fell out of use, though, as railways were developed, becoming the main way of moving goods and people from one end of the country to the other.## 运河对货物运输特别重要。因为铁路发展起来了,运河交通逐渐衰落。铁路跨越国土,从国家的一端跑到另一端,成为运输旅客和货物的主要方式。\n[04:13.49]And the goods they moved weren't just coal, iron, clothes, and so on - significantly, they included newspapers, which meant that thousands of people were not only more knowledgeable about what was going on in the country, but could also read about what was available in the shops. And that encouraged them to buy more. ##运输的货物不仅仅是煤、铁、衣服等商品,更重要的是,报纸也在运输物品之列,这意味着成千上万的人不仅可以增加对这个国家的情况的了解,还可以阅读商店里商品的相关信息。这促进了销售。\n[04:36.01]So faster forms of transport resulted in distribution becoming far more efficient- goods could now be sold all over the country, instead of just in the local market.##因此,更快的运输方式促使配送效率大大提高——不仅仅是在当地市场,还可以在全国各地销售商品。\n[04:49.32]The third main area that saw changes that contributed to consumerism was retailing. The number and quality of shops grew rapidly, and in particular, small shops suffered as customers flocked to the growing number of department stores - a form of retailing that was new in the 19th century.##导致消费主义的第三个主要领域是零售业。商店的数量和品质迅速增加,小商店的情况更加糟糕,因为成群结队的顾客跑去百货商场购物。这是19世纪新出现的一种零售形式。\n[05:11.22]The entrepreneurs who opened these found new ways to stock them with goods, and to attract customers: for instance, improved lighting inside greatly increased the visibility of the goods for sale. Another development that made goods more visible from outside resulted from the use of plate glass, which made it possible for windows to be much larger than previously. ##百货商店的老板们找到了新的方法来储存货物,招揽顾客。比如,增加室内照明来让售卖的商品变得更加显眼。另一个让商品从外面看起来更显眼的方式是使用平板玻璃。这使得窗户比以前大得多。\n[05:40.24]New ways of promoting goods were introduced, too. Previously, the focus had been on informing potential customers about the availability of goods; now there was an explosion in advertising trying to persuade people to go shopping.##新的促销方式也被引入。以前,人们关注的焦点是向潜在客户告知商品的供应情况。现如今激增的广告试图说服顾客购买商品。\n[05:57.87]Flanders claims that one of the great effects of the Industrial Revolution was that it created choice. All sorts of things that had previously been luxuries - from sugar to cutlery - became conveniences, and before long they'd turned into necessities: life without sugar or cutlery was unimaginable. ##弗兰德斯声称,工业革命的一个重大影响是它创造了选择。所有以前是奢侈品的东西——从糖到餐具—变得更加易得。而且它们很快就变成了必需品,没有糖和餐具的生活是难以想象的。\n[06:21.52]Rather like mobile phones these days!##就像现在的手机。\n[06:27.38]",
